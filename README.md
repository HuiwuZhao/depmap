# The `depmap` package

[**depmap**](https://github.com/tfkillian/depmap/) is an R data 
package that loads 7 cancer dependency omics datasets, which are loaded as .rmd
files using data(). The .rmd files were generated by using devtools::use_data 
function. The original .csv files for the datasets can also be downloaded 
directly from the Broad Institute website [depmap](https://depmap.org/portal/download/). 
As the DepMap screening efforts continue, the [**depmap**](https://github.com/tfkillian/depmap/) 
package will updated on a quarterly basis, in line with the Broad Institute [depmap](https://depmap.org/portal/download/) cancer dependency mapping initiative. 
This project was started by [Theo Killian](http://tfkillian.github/) in February 2019.
