Title: Cancer Dependency Map Data Package
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Theo Killian
Maintainer: The package maintainer <theo.killian@gmail.com>
Description: The DepMap Public 19Q1 release includes CRISPR screen and
    omics datasets expanded to include new cell lines. The Avana
    CRISPR screen dataset is expanded to include 558 cell
    lines. Mutation, copy number and gene expression data are also
    expanded to include new lines in Avana dataset. As our screening
    efforts continue, we will be releasing additional cancer
    dependency data on a quarterly basis.  The CRISPR screen uses the
    Avana CRISPR-Cas9 genome-scale knockout library, and descriptions
    of the experimental methods and the CERES algorithm are published
    in here. This dataset also includes batch-corrected versions of
    gene_effect, gene_dependency, and pan_dependent_genes, and the
    portal shows this batch corrected version of gene_effect. See the
    README file for more detail.  Copy number and mutation data for
    some cell lines were based on Sanger Institute whole exome
    sequencing data (COSMIC: http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cell_lines,
    EGA accession number: EGAD00001001039), then reprocessed. Omics
    processing for 19Q1 has changed as follows.  Expression: We use
    the GTEx pipeline. Since last release, there have been some
    updates to the versions of different components of the pipeline
    and minor bug fixes on GTEx's end.  Mutation: In this release, we
    additionally process DepMap WES samples through the CGA mutation
    calling pipeline adapted for cell lines and available on
    FireCloud. We have added a column for the allele counts from this
    pipeline run (CGA_WES_AC). Previously, the WES_AC column was
    generated from running the Van Allen mutation calling pipeline for
    SNPs + Mutect2 for INDELs. This column is now named VA_WES_AC.
