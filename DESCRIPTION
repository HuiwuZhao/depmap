Description: The depmap package is a data package that contains
    datsets from the [Broad Institute DepMap](https://depmap.org/portal/)
    cancer cell line dependency map study. Seven datsets from the most
    current 19Q1 release are available: `rnai_19Q1`, `crispr_19Q1`,
    `copyNumber_19Q1`, `TPM_19Q1`, `RPPA_19Q1`, `mutationCalls_19Q1` and
    `metadata_19Q1`. The `rnai_19Q1` and `crispr_19Q1` datasets
    respectively contain RNAI and CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockout screens of
    human genes relating to the genetic dependency for select cancer cell
    lines. Additional datasets relating to the log copy number of select
    genes (`copyNumber_19Q1`), as well as protein expression measured
    by reverse phase protein lysate microarray (`RPPA_19Q1`) and
    'Transcript Per Million' (`TPM_19Q1`) are also provided. Supplementary
    datasets `metadata_19Q1` and `mutationCalls_19Q1` are also added,
    which contain metadatafor the other datasets found in the current
    DepMap Public 19Q1 release. The depmap R package will be updated on a
    quarterly basis to incorporate the latest [Broad Institute DepMap](https://depmap.org/portal/)
    Public cancer dependency datasets. All data made available in this
    package was generated by the [Broad Institute DepMap](https://depmap.org/portal/)
    for research purposes and are not intended for clinical use. The data
