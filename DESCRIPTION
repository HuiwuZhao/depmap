Title: Cancer Dependency Map Data Package
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Theo Killian
Maintainer: The package maintainer <theo.killian@gmail.com>
Description: The depmap package is a data package that contains datsets
    from the Broad Institute DepMap Public 19Q1 release, converted to long form
    data for easier data analysis and visualization in R. Seven datsets are made 
    available upon loading this package: `rnai`, `crispr`, `copyNumber`, `TPM`, 
    `RPPA`, `mutationCalls` and `metadata`. The `rnai` and `crispr` datasets 
    each respectively contain RNAI and CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockout screens of 
    human genes relating to the genetic dependency for select cancer cell lines. 
    Additional datasets relating to the log copy number of select genes 
    (`copyNumber`), as well as protein expression measured by reverse phase 
    protein lysate microarray (`RPPA`) and 'Transcript Per Million' (`TPM`) are 
    also provided. The last two datasets `metadata` and `mutationCalls` contain 
    metadata for the other datasets found in the DepMap Public 19Q1 release. The
    depmap R package will be updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate the 
    latest release of the Broad Institute DepMap Public cancer dependency 
    datasets.
